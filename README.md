  * **🤖 AI-Powered Motivation**: Personalized motivational messages from Google's Gemini AI that adapt to the user's tone (funny, supportive, crass, etc.) and context.
  * **⚖️ Weight Loss Integration**: Track body metrics like weight and waist measurements, visualize the correlation with hydration, and set goals.
  * **🔔 Smart Notifications**: Intelligent push notifications (and backup SMS reminders) with AI-generated content timed to the user's schedule.
  * **📱 Outstanding User Experience**: A clean, modern, mobile-first design with dark/light modes, offline capabilities, and a high standard of accessibility.

## 🚀 Developer Setup: Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the development environment.

### 1. Prerequisites

  * Node.js (v18 or later)
  * NPM (or Yarn)
  * Firebase CLI

### 2. Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd water4weightloss
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### 3. Credentials Setup

The application requires credentials for Firebase, Google AI, and Twilio.

#### Step 1: Get Firebase Service Account Key (for Local Development)

For local development, the server needs secret credentials to act on your behalf.

1.  In your Firebase Project Settings, go to the **Service accounts** tab.
2.  Click **Generate new private key** and a JSON file will be downloaded.
3.  **Rename this file to `service-account.json`**.
4.  Place the `service-account.json` file in the **root directory** of the project. This file is listed in `.gitignore` and will not be committed.

#### Step 2: Create and Populate `.env.local`

Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project. Copy the template below and fill it with your credentials. **This is for local development only.** Your deployed application uses a more secure method to access these secrets.

```bash
# .env.local

# --- Firebase Client SDK (Public Keys) ---
# Find these in Firebase Console > Project Settings > General > Your apps > SDK setup and configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=

# --- Google AI (Server-Side Secret) ---
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=

# --- Twilio for SMS Reminders (Server-Side Secrets) ---
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=
```

*   Fill in the `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables from your Firebase project settings.
*   Fill in your API keys for Google AI and Twilio.

### 4. Run the Application

Start the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3002` or another specified port.

## ⏰ Setting Up Scheduled Reminders

The application includes a `sendReminder` server action that can send Push and SMS notifications. To make this run automatically, you need to trigger it on a schedule. The recommended way is using **Google Cloud Scheduler**.

1.  **Deploy your application.** The scheduler needs a public URL to call.
2.  Go to the **Google Cloud Scheduler** in your Google Cloud Console.
3.  Create a new job with the following settings:
    *   **Target type**: `HTTP`
    *   **URL**: `https://<your-deployed-app-url>/api/cron/send-reminders` (You will need to create this API route that calls the `sendReminder` action for each user).
    *   **Frequency**: A cron schedule like `0 * * * *` to run it every hour.
    *   **Authentication**: You should secure this endpoint, for example, by requiring a secret key in the header that your scheduler job provides.

*Note: A full implementation of the cron job API route is beyond the scope of this file but involves fetching all users and calling the `sendReminder(userId)` action for each.*
