## üöÄ Developer Setup: Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the development environment.

### 1\. Prerequisites

  * Node.js (v18 or later)
  * NPM (or Yarn)
  * Firebase CLI

### 2\. Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd water4weightloss
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### 3\. Environment Variables & Service Account

**Step 1: Create `.env.local`**

Create a file named `.env.local` in the root directory and populate it with the necessary keys from your Firebase project and third-party services.

```bash
# .env.local

# --- Firebase Client SDK (Public Keys) ---
# These are safe to expose to the browser and are used to identify your app.
# Find these in your Firebase project settings under "General" -> "Your apps" -> "SDK setup and configuration".
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=

# --- Server-Side Service Secrets (for Local Development) ---
# These are required ONLY for running the server-side code on your local machine.
# Copy these values from your Firebase service-account.json file.
# IMPORTANT: The private key must be enclosed in double quotes.
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=""
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=""
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=""

# --- Other Services (Server-Side Secrets) ---
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=
```

**Step 2: Get Your Service Account Credentials**

For local development, you need the three `FIREBASE_*` values.
1.  In your Firebase Project Settings, go to the **Service accounts** tab.
2.  Click **Generate new private key** and download the JSON file.
3.  Open the downloaded file and copy the `project_id`, `client_email`, and `private_key` values into the corresponding variables in your `.env.local` file.
4.  **Important:** For the `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`, ensure the entire key, including `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`, is enclosed in double quotes (`"`).

### 4\. Run the Application

Start the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

The codebase is organized into a clean, modern Next.js project structure.

## ü§ñ AI Development & Contribution

This project is being built with an AI development agent (Gemini). To ensure quality, consistency, and adherence to the project vision, all contributions (human or AI) **must** follow the rules outlined in the **`STUDIO_AI_RULES.md`** file.

This manifesto governs our development philosophy, including:

  * Thinking full-stack and avoiding tunnel vision.
  * Writing durable, high-quality code instead of quick patches.
  * Prioritizing security and cost-optimization for Firebase services.
