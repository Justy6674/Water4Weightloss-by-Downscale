## üöÄ Developer Setup: Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the development environment.

### 1. Prerequisites

  * Node.js (v18 or later)
  * NPM (or Yarn)
  * Firebase CLI

### 2. Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd water4weightloss
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### 3. Environment & Credentials Setup

You will need to set up environment variables in a `.env.local` file for both the client-side (browser) and server-side (for local development).

#### Step 1: Create the `.env.local` File

Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project. Copy and paste the following template into it:

```bash
# .env.local

# --- Firebase Client SDK (Public Keys) ---
# Find these in Firebase Console > Project Settings > General > Your apps > SDK setup and configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=

# --- Firebase Admin SDK (Server-Side Secrets for Local Dev) ---
# You will get these from your service-account.json file in the next step
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=

# --- Other Services (Server-Side Secrets) ---
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=
```

#### Step 2: Get a Service Account Key

For local development, the server needs secret credentials to act on your behalf.

1.  In your Firebase Project Settings, go to the **Service accounts** tab.
2.  Click **Generate new private key** and a JSON file will be downloaded. This file is your **`service-account.json`**.
3.  **Do not commit this file to git.** It is only used to copy credentials from.

#### Step 3: Populate `.env.local` with Your Credentials

Now, copy the values from `service-account.json` and your Firebase project settings into your `.env.local` file.

*   Fill in the `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables from your Firebase project settings.
*   Fill in the `FIREBASE_*` server-side variables using the values from the `service-account.json` file you just downloaded.

**IMPORTANT:** For the `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`, you must copy the entire key, including the `-----BEGIN...` and `-----END...` markers, and wrap it in **double quotes** to handle the newline characters correctly.

Example:
```bash
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL="firebase-adminsdk-....@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_KEY_LINE_1\nYOUR_KEY_LINE_2\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```

### 4. Run the Application

Start the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3002`.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

The codebase is organized into a clean, modern Next.js project structure.
